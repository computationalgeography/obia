This repo contains python scripts and eCognition rule sets used for the RWS OBIA project. 

The folder [rule_sets](rule_sets) contains the eCognition rule set file.   

The folder [scripts](scripts) contains the python scripts that are needed for pre-processing (i.e. making tiles) and post-processing (i.e. merging tiles back) steps before and after eCognition processes.   

All files were firstly created by Harke Douma and further developed by Lars Groeneveld and Edwin H. Sutanudjaja.
